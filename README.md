# Finance Dashboard CI/CD Pipeline with Observability, Rollback & Multi-Cloud Deployment

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a fully automated, end-to-end **CI/CD pipeline** for a **finance dashboard application**, ensuring seamless deployment, testing, monitoring, and rollback capabilities. The pipeline is designed using **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation and **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)** for deployment. Additionally, it incorporates **Prometheus & Grafana** for observability and an **automated rollback mechanism** in case of deployment failures.

## 🏆 Task Breakdown

### 📌 Task 1: Repository & Application Preparation
1. **Cloned the finance dashboard app** from GitHub.
2. **Restructured the project** into a production-grade repository with `client`, `server`, `tests`, `ci-cd`, and `docs` folders.
3. Ensured the application **runs locally without issues** using:
   ```bash
   cd client && npm install && npm start
   cd ../server && npm install && npm start
   ```
4. Documented **key features & known issues**.

---
### 📌 Task 2: CI/CD Platform & Workflow Configuration
#### ✅ **GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow**
Created a **GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) that includes:
- **Build Stage**: Installs dependencies and runs static code analysis.
- **Test Stage**: Runs unit & integration tests (requires 80%+ coverage).
- **Dockerization**: Builds a Docker image and pushes it to AWS ECR.
- **Deployment**: Deploys the application to AWS ECS.
- **Observability**: Sends monitoring data to Prometheus & Grafana.
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Triggers `rollback.sh` if the deployment fails.

---
### 📌 Task 3: Automated Testing & Multi-Cloud Deployment
1. **Automated Test Suite Integration:**
   - Used **Jest** for backend unit tests.
   - Used **Cypress** for frontend end-to-end tests.
2. **Multi-Region Deployment Setup:**
   - Configured AWS ECS deployments in **us-east-1** & **eu-west-1**.
   - Used GitHub Actions to deploy to both AWS and simulated GCP.
3. **Rollback Validation:**
   - Simulated deployment failures & ensured **rollback scripts execute successfully**.

---
### 📌 Task 4: Documentation & Submission
- Created a **comprehensive README.md** explaining CI/CD, ECS, observability, and rollback.
- Added **deployment logs, architecture diagrams, & test results**.
- Submitted **GitHub repository with all required files**.

## 📦 AWS ECS Deployment Explanation
AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) is used to deploy and manage containers in AWS.

### **Steps for Deployment:**
1. **Created an AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) repository** to store Docker images.
2. **Configured AWS ECS Fargate Cluster**:
   ```bash
   aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name finance-dashboard-cluster
   ```
3. **Defined ECS Task Definition** (`ecs-task-def.json`):
   - Specifies **Docker image**, **CPU/memory allocation**, and **network settings**.
4. **Created ECS Service** linked to an ALB (Application Load Balancer).
5. **Automated Deployment via GitHub Actions**:
   - Every code push triggers **build, test, push to ECR, and deploy to ECS**.

## 📊 Observability & Monitoring
### ✅ **Prometheus & Grafana Setup**
1. Configured **Prometheus** to collect application metrics.
2. Created **Grafana dashboards** to visualize metrics & set up alerts.
3. Configured **Slack notifications** for deployment failures.

---
## 🔄 Rollback Mechanism
### ✅ **Automated Rollback Implementation**
1. **Health checks & error threshold monitoring**.
2. If deployment fails, **rollback.sh** script automatically redeploys the last stable version.
3. Logs every rollback action for debugging purposes.
